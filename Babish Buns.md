500 g bread flour 
7 g instant dry yeast
25 g granulated sugar 
100 g whole milk, warm (~85 °F)
200 g water, warm (~85 °F)
5 g table salt
85 g unsalted butter, cubed + very soft (~75-80 °F)

Instructions
1. Combine the flour, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer.
2. Evenly combine the dry ingredients using a whisk or fork. 
3. Add the milk, water, and salt to the bowl. With the mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine the dough on medium low speed until almost homogeneous. 
4. Begin adding the butter, one cube at a time and waiting until each cube is incorporated before adding another one, until all of the butter has been added. 
5. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough is smooth, elastic, and clears the sides of the bowl, about 6-8 minutes.
6. Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl and cover it with a clean dish towel or plate.
7. Let the dough proof until about doubled in size, about 1-2 hours depending on the warmth of the room. 
8. Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a lightly oiled work surface. Divide and shape the dough into 6 even buns. Transfer the buns to a parchment-lined sheet tray.
9. Loosely over the buns, and allow the dough to proof for another 45 minutes - 1 hour, until puffed.
10. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 °F. 
11. Once risen, brush the buns with the egg wash and sprinkle them with sesame seeds.
12. Bake the buns for 30-35 minutes, turning halfway through, until the dough is cooked through (200-205 °F) and golden brown on top. 
13. Allow the buns to cool completely before slicing.
