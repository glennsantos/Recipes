### Ingredients

**12 servings**

* 500g bread flour
* 7g instant yeast
* 25 sugar
* 5g salt
* 100g milk, whole liquid
* 200g water
* 85g unsalted butter, soft
* egg yolk, for brushing (optional)
* sesame seeds, for topping (optional)

### Instructions

1. Combine dry ingredients and stir
2. Heat liquid ingredients to 85F (30C)
3. Add liquid ingredients. If making a bigger batch, bloom the yeast first so you have a faster rise and shorter baking time. This means your second batch will not overproof
4. Knead with dough hook until no dry spots remain
5. Add butter one piece at a time, adding next when the previous is already fully incorporated. Dough is okay when no visible butter spots remain.
6. Knead for 10 more minutes then do window pane test and check if soft and springy. The dough must be one coherent mass at this time
7. Shape into ball and let rise for 30 minutes or until 100% larger
8. Oil countertop
9. Weigh to around 70-75g per ball. Flatten with rolling pin, flip then fold into center like an envelope. Roll on surface until top is taut.
10. Roll over sesame seeds and brush with egg yolk (optional).
11. Rest for 20 minutes until 50% larger, preferably in the oven receptacle so no need to moving. Can rest for longer (up to 30 minutes) if you want a poofier bun.
12. Bake for 150C for 15 minutes in air fryer for 4 pieces. Tweak this depending on the size of your batch and size of your oven. Bigger batch = longer cook time, lower temp.
13. Let it rest in a cooling rack.
14. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat when ready to consume.
