12 servings

500g bread flour
7g instant yeast
25 sugar
5g salt
100g milk

200g water
85g unsalted butter

Instructions
Step 1
Combine dry ingredients and stir
Step 2
Heat liquid ingredients to 85F (30C)
Step 3
Add liquid ingredients. If making a bigger batch, bloom the yeast first so you have a faster rise and shorter baking time. This means your second batch will not overproof.
Step 4
Knead with dough hook until no dry spots remain
Step 5
Add butter one piece at a time, adding next when the previous is already fully incorporated. Dough is okay when no visible butter spots remain.
Step 6
Knead for 10 more minutes then do window pane test and check if soft and springy. The dough must be one coherent mass at this time
Step 7
Shape into ball and let rise for 30 minutes or until 100% larger
Step 8
Oil countertop
Step 9
Weigh to around 70-75g per ball. Flatten with rolling pin, flip then fold into center like an envelope. Roll on surface until top is taut.
Step 10
Roll over sesame seeds and brush with egg yolk (optional).
Step 11
Rest for 20 minutes until 50% larger, preferably in the oven receptacle so no need to moving. Can rest for longer (up to 30 minutes) if you want a poofier bun.
Step 12
Bake for 150C for 15 minutes in air fryer for 4 pieces. Tweak this depending on the size of your batch and size of your oven. Bigger batch = longer cook time, lower temp.
Step 13
Let it rest in a cooling rack.
Step 14
Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat when ready to consume.
