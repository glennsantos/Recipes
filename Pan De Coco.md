Step 7
If you are using dry active yeast, you need to activate by adding 1/2 cup of lukewarm water and set aside for 5 minutes or when bubbles form. If you are using instant yeast you can directly add to dry ingredients.
Step 8
In a mixing bowl put bread flour, powdered milk, sugar and mix well together. (if you are using instant yeast, you can add it with the rest of the dry ingredients).
Step 9
When the yeast mixture is activated (bubbles forming on top of mixture), add the egg and pour in with the dry ingredients.
Step 10
Using a stand mixer with the hook attachment, mix everything in low speed until well incorporated.
Step 11
Then add butter and salt and continue beating in low speed for 5 mins. When the butter mixed well with the dough continue beating in medium speed until your dough becomes soft and elastic.
Step 12
Removed dough from mixing bowl then place it in another bowl greased with cooking oil and let it rise for 1 hour or depending on the humidity.
Step 13
When the dough doubled in size you know you achieved a good rise. Dump the dough on the table or counter and punch the dough to release the air/gas inside.
